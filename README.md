# niklibtool
Registers Kontakt 5 Libraries on recent Mac OS X versions. If your libraries disappiear after being added, this script will register them proper.

Run it in terminal as root with a path to where your libraries are located as an argument.

Example: `sudo ./niklibtool.py ~/Documents/Instruments`

If your libraries do not appear after running the script, add the same directory in DB Options, scan and restart Kontakt.

Cheers!
